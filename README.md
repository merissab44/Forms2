# Forms2

Welcome To my Forms Assignemt! 

In this assignment I practiced templating in Flask with 4 different tasks. 
I have a templates folder that holds all of my static html files and in the app.py I am able to use the data entered and render different pages.

In this assignment you will see:
A fro-yo order form,
A calculator form,
A secret message text area, 
and a horoscope form.

The secret message task is the only one that uses a POST method which sends private data to the server to use.

This project also includes template inheritance so I didn't have to rewrite boiler plate code.

Most of this project was written with Python and HTML.
Enjoy!
